## Executive Summary

**System Overview:** Cloud-native Learning Management System for Shiksha tuition center with Spring Boot backend, React frontend, and AWS infrastructure.

**Key Architecture Decisions:**
- **Backend:** Spring Boot 3.x with Spring Modulith (modular monolith)
- **Frontend:** React 18+ with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- **Database:** PostgreSQL on AWS RDS with performance optimization
- **File Storage:** AWS S3 with CloudFront CDN
- **Infrastructure:** Terraform-managed AWS infrastructure
- **Authentication:** JWT tokens with role-based authorization

**Business Value:** Streamlined digital workflow for assignment sharing, exam scheduling, and grade management across Math, Physics, and Chemistry subjects for grades 9-12.

### Database Schema Overview

**Core Tables:**
- **users:** User accounts with role-based access (teachers/students)
- **subjects:** Available subjects (Math, Physics, Chemistry)
- **user_subjects:** Enrollment mapping between users and subjects
- **assignments:** Teacher-created assignments with file references
- **assignment_submissions:** Student-submitted assignment solutions
- **exams:** Scheduled examinations with details
- **grades:** Exam results and performance tracking
- **email_notifications:** Notification delivery tracking

**Key Design Decisions:**
- **Role-based design:** Single users table with role differentiation
- **Flexible enrollment:** Many-to-many relationship for subject enrollment
- **File references:** Store S3 keys rather than direct file content
- **Audit trails:** Comprehensive timestamp and status tracking
- **Performance optimization:** Strategic indexing for common queries

### Performance Optimization Strategy

**Database Indexing:**
- **Primary performance indexes** on frequently queried columns
- **Composite indexes** for complex query patterns
- **Partial indexes** for filtered queries (active records only)
- **Foreign key indexes** for efficient joins

**Query Optimization:**
- **Database views** for complex dashboard queries
- **Materialized views** for heavy analytical queries (future enhancement)
- **Connection pooling** with optimized pool sizes
- **Query plan monitoring** and optimization

## Security Architecture

### Authentication & Authorization

**JWT Token Structure:**
- **Payload:** userId, email, role, subjects, permissions
- **Expiration:** 24 hours for access token, 7 days for refresh token
- **Algorithm:** HS512 for development, RS256 for production
- **Storage:** HTTP-only cookies for web, secure storage for mobile

**Role-Based Access Control:**

| Resource | Teacher | Student |
|----------|---------|---------|
| Create Assignment | ✅ Own Subject | ❌ |
| View Assignment | ✅ All | ✅ Own Grade/Subject |
| Submit Assignment | ❌ | ✅ Own Assignments |
| Schedule Exam | ✅ Own Subject | ❌ |
| Enter Grades | ✅ Own Exams | ❌ |
| View Student Performance | ✅ Own Students | ❌ |
| View Own Grades | ❌ | ✅ Own Only |

### File Security Architecture

**Upload Security:**
- **File Type Validation:** PDF only, MIME type and file signature verification
- **File Size Limits:** 10MB maximum per file
- **Malware Scanning:** Integration capability for virus detection
- **Secure Naming:** UUID-based filenames to prevent path traversal

**Access Control:**
- **S3 Bucket Policies:** No public access, signed URLs for downloads
- **Time-Limited Access:** Presigned URLs with 24-hour expiration
- **Audit Trail:** All file access logged with user context
- **Cross-Reference Validation:** Ensure users can only access authorized files

### Data Protection

**Encryption Strategy:**
- **Data at Rest:** S3 server-side encryption, RDS encryption
- **Data in Transit:** TLS 1.3 for all communications
- **Password Security:** BCrypt hashing with salt rounds
- **Sensitive Data:** AWS KMS integration for additional encryption layers

**Security Monitoring:**
- **Authentication Monitoring:** Failed login attempts, suspicious patterns
- **Authorization Auditing:** Access denied events, permission escalations
- **File Access Tracking:** Complete audit trail for file operations
- **Security Event Correlation:** Automated analysis of security patterns

- **Security Groups:** Network-level access control and firewall rules

**Subnet Strategy:**
- **Public Subnets:** Load balancer and NAT gateway placement
- **Private Subnets:** Application servers and database instances
- **Database Subnets:** Isolated database subnet group for RDS

### Infrastructure as Code

**Terraform Organization:**
- **Modular Structure:** Separate modules for networking, compute, storage
- **Environment Separation:** Dev, staging, and production configurations
- **State Management:** Remote state storage with locking mechanism
- **Resource Tagging:** Comprehensive tagging for cost allocation and management

## File Management System

### AWS S3 Integration Strategy

**S3 Bucket Organization:**
```
File Storage Bucket Structure:
├── assignments/
│   ├── math/grade9/, math/grade10/, math/grade11/, math/grade12/
│   ├── physics/grade9/, physics/grade10/, physics/grade11/, physics/grade12/
│   └── chemistry/grade9/, chemistry/grade10/, chemistry/grade11/, chemistry/grade12/
└── submissions/
    ├── math/, physics/, chemistry/
    └── Organized by subject and student
```

### File Processing Workflow

**File Upload Process:**
1. **Frontend Validation:** File type, size, and format validation
2. **Backend Validation:** Secondary validation with file signature checking
3. **S3 Upload:** Direct upload with metadata tagging and security policies
4. **Database Recording:** Store file metadata and S3 object key
5. **Notification Trigger:** Async event publishing for email notifications

**File Download Process:**
1. **Authorization Check:** Verify user permissions for file access
2. **Presigned URL Generation:** Create time-limited S3 access URL
3. **Audit Logging:** Record file access for security monitoring
4. **Redirect Response:** HTTP 302 redirect to presigned URL

### File Security Controls

**Access Control Strategy:**
- **IAM Policies:** Restrict S3 access to authorized application components only
- **Bucket Policies:** No public read access, private bucket configuration
- **Presigned URLs:** Time-limited access (24-hour expiration) for downloads
- **File Validation:** Multi-layer validation including MIME type verification

**File Metadata Management:**
- **Database References:** Store S3 object keys, not direct URLs
- **Metadata Storage:** File size, upload timestamp, original filename
- **Version Control:** S3 versioning enabled for assignment updates
- **Cleanup Policies:** Automated deletion of orphaned files and old versions

## Notification System

### Event-Driven Architecture

**Notification Flow:**
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Domain Event] --> B[Event Publisher]
    B --> C[SQS Queue]
    C --> D[SQS Consumer]
    D --> E[Email Template Engine]
    E --> F[Amazon SES]
    F --> G[Email Delivery]
    D --> H[Database Logging]
```

**Event Types:**
- **AssignmentCreatedEvent:** New assignment posted by teacher
- **SubmissionCreatedEvent:** Student submits assignment
- **ExamScheduledEvent:** New exam scheduled
- **GradePostedEvent:** Exam grades entered by teacher

### Email Notification System

**Template Categories:**
- **Assignment Notifications:** New assignment alerts to students
- **Submission Notifications:** Assignment submission alerts to teachers
- **Exam Notifications:** Exam scheduling alerts to students
- **Grade Notifications:** Grade posting alerts to students

**Template Variables:**
- **Personalization:** Student/teacher names, subject information
- **Context Data:** Assignment titles, exam dates, grade scores
- **Action Links:** Direct links to relevant dashboard sections
- **Branding:** Consistent branding and styling

### Reliability and Fault Tolerance

**Message Processing:**
- **SQS Integration:** Reliable message queuing with delivery guarantees
- **Dead Letter Queue:** Failed messages for manual review and reprocessing
- **Retry Logic:** Automatic retry for transient failures (maximum 3 attempts)
- **Delivery Tracking:** Database logging of notification status and delivery confirmation

**Performance Optimization:**
- **Async Processing:** Non-blocking notification processing
- **Batch Processing:** Efficient handling of bulk notifications
- **Rate Limiting:** Respect SES sending limits and quotas
- **Error Handling:** Graceful degradation for notification failures
