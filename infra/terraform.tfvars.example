environment  = "dev"  # dev, staging, prod
aws_region   = "us-east-1"

# =====================================================
# S3 CONFIGURATION
# =====================================================

# Leave s3_bucket_name as null to auto-generate a unique name
# Or specify a custom name (must be globally unique)
s3_bucket_name = null

# Enable versioning for file history (recommended for production)
s3_versioning_enabled = true

# =====================================================

# Required: From email address for notifications
# This email must be verified in SES (you'll verify this after deployment)
# Use Gmail, Yahoo, or any personal email for testing
ses_from_email = "your-email@gmail.com"

# List of email addresses to verify for SES (for testing)
# These emails will be able to receive notifications
verified_email_addresses = [
  "teacher@example.com",
  "student@example.com"
]

# =====================================================
# SQS CONFIGURATION
# =====================================================

# How long (in seconds) a message is hidden after being received
sqs_visibility_timeout = 300

# Number of times a message can be received before moving to DLQ
sqs_max_receive_count = 3

# =====================================================
# RESOURCE TAGS

tags = {

# =====================================================
# NOTES FOR DEPLOYMENT
# =====================================================

# Before running terraform apply:
# 1. Replace "your-email@gmail.com" with your actual email address
# 2. Add teacher/student emails to verified_email_addresses for testing
# 3. Update aws_region if needed (us-east-1 is cheapest for SES)
# 4. After deployment, verify all email addresses in AWS SES console
# 5. SES starts in sandbox mode - you can only send to verified addresses
# 6. Request production access from AWS to send to any email address
