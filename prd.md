## 3. Technical Requirements

### 3.1 Recommended Technology Stack

Based on current best practices for educational platforms and your requirements:

**Frontend:**
- **React 18+** with TypeScript for type safety and better developer experience
- **React Router DOM** for client-side routing
- **Tailwind CSS** for rapid, responsive UI development
- **React Hook Form + Zod** for robust form handling and validation
- **Axios** for API communication

**Backend:**
- **Java 21** with **Spring Boot 3.x**
- **Spring Modulith** for modular architecture and better domain separation
- **Spring Security** with JWT tokens for authentication and authorization
- **Spring Data JPA** for database operations
- **Spring Web** for REST API development
- **AWS SDK for Java** with **Amazon SES** for email notifications
- **Spring Cloud AWS SQS** for reliable notification queuing
- **Spring Boot File Upload** for secure PDF handling

**Database & Storage:**
- **PostgreSQL** for structured data (users, assignments, grades, schedules)
- **AWS S3** for secure PDF file storage and React app static files
- **AWS CloudFront** for global content delivery and frontend hosting

**Infrastructure:**
- **AWS S3 + CloudFront** for React frontend hosting with global CDN
- **AWS EC2** or **AWS Elastic Beanstalk** for Spring Boot application hosting
- **AWS SQS** for reliable notification message queuing
- **Amazon SES** for email notifications
- **AWS RDS PostgreSQL** for managed database hosting

### 3.2 Security Requirements

Given the file upload functionality, security is critical:

- **File Validation:** Restrict file uploads to PDF only, validate MIME types and file signatures
- **File Storage:** Store files in AWS S3 with proper access controls and randomized names
- **Access Control:** Role-based authentication with JWT tokens
- **Input Sanitization:** Validate all form inputs and file names
- **File Size Limits:** Maximum 10MB per file upload
- **HTTPS Only:** All communications encrypted in transit via CloudFront

### 3.3 Database Schema & Architecture

**Database Strategy:** **Single PostgreSQL database** with **logical module separation** via table naming and Spring Modulith boundaries.

**Why Single Database for Shiksha:**
- Small to medium scale tuition center doesn't require microservices complexity
- Maintains data consistency with ACID transactions
- Simplified backup, monitoring, and maintenance
- Cost-effective (one RDS instance vs multiple)
- Easier cross-module queries (student grades across subjects)

## 6. Development Considerations

### 6.1 Technical Architecture

```
CloudFront CDN (Global)
    ↓ Static files (React App)
AWS S3 Bucket (Frontend + PDF Storage)
    ↑ Upload/Download PDF files
React Frontend (TypeScript)
    ↓ REST API calls
AWS Load Balancer/EC2 (Spring Boot App)
    ├── User Management Module
    ├── Assignment Module
    ├── Assessment Module
    ├── Exam Scheduling Module
    └── Notification Module
            ↓ Queue messages
        AWS SQS (Notification Queue)
            ↓ Process messages
        SQS Consumer → Amazon SES
    ↓ Database queries
AWS RDS (PostgreSQL)
```

**Enhanced Architecture with SQS Benefits:**
- **Reliable Notifications:** SQS ensures email notifications are never lost
- **Asynchronous Processing:** User actions complete instantly, emails sent in background
- **Fault Tolerance:** If SES fails, messages remain in queue for retry
- **Scalability:** Handle notification bursts during peak times (exam announcements)
- **Monitoring:** CloudWatch integration for queue metrics and alerting
- **Dead Letter Queue:** Failed notifications moved to DLQ for investigation

### 6.3 Risk Assessment & Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| File upload vulnerabilities | High | Medium | Implement strict file validation, store in S3 with proper access controls |
| Amazon SES delivery failures | Medium | Low | Use SES with proper error handling, implement retry logic |
| Data loss | High | Low | Regular automated backups, version control |
| Poor mobile experience | Medium | Medium | Mobile-first responsive design, thorough testing |
| MCP server integration complexity (future) | Medium | Medium | Plan for proper API design, comprehensive testing |
